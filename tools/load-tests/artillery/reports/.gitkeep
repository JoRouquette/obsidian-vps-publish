# Artillery Load Test Reports

This directory contains generated Artillery load test reports (JSON and HTML).

All files in this directory are gitignored except this .gitkeep file.

## Generated Files

When you run load tests with the `:report` suffix, Artillery will generate timestamped JSON files:

```
reports/
├── quick-20251227-161530.json
├── load-50-20251227-162045.json
├── load-200-20251227-163012.json
└── ...
```

## Generating HTML Reports

To convert JSON reports to HTML:

```bash
artillery report reports/load-50-20251227-162045.json --output reports/load-50.html
```

Or use the npm scripts with `:report` suffix:

```bash
npm run load:api:50:report
# Generates: reports/load-50-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.json
```

## Viewing Reports

Open HTML reports in your browser:

```bash
# Windows
start reports/load-50.html

# macOS
open reports/load-50.html

# Linux
xdg-open reports/load-50.html
```

## Cleaning Up

To remove old reports:

```bash
# Remove all JSON reports older than 7 days
find tools/load-tests/artillery/reports/ -name "*.json" -mtime +7 -delete

# Remove all reports (keeps .gitkeep)
rm -f tools/load-tests/artillery/reports/*.json tools/load-tests/artillery/reports/*.html
```

## Report Contents

Artillery reports include:

- **Summary metrics**: scenarios completed/failed, requests, response times
- **Percentiles**: p50, p95, p99 response times
- **Status codes**: breakdown of HTTP responses
- **Errors**: detailed error messages if any
- **Timeline**: request rate and response time over duration
